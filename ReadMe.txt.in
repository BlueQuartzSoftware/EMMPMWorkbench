Notes for Compilation:

The Code/MXA directory is a subset of the full MXADataModel distribution. I only
pulled in what was needed for this project. For the shared_pointers the implementation
from Qt is being used instead of the boost implementation. This reduces the number of
dependencies of the project.

The Code/IPHelper/plugins/CrossCorrelation will depend on the libTiff library being present although
it is only needed for the bmp to tiff file conversion utility. If you do not need to 
convert your bmp files to tiff files first then you will not need the libTiff library
as the one from the Qt distribution will be used instead. The Cross Correlation is
dependent on the ITK (www.itk.org) software library. ITK should be compiled and ready
to use before trying to compile the Cross Correlation GUI.
