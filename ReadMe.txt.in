** Getting the complete Source Code **
When you cloned this source code repository you should have used the --recursive flag
git clone --recursive git://scm.bluequartz.net/eim/emmpmgui.gi
This will make sure to also checkout a couple of supporting projects into the "Support"
subfolder. The EMMPM Library is one of those and the "CMP" project is another. Both
are required in order to compile the EMMPMGui application. If you did not use the 
--recursive flag you can run the following commands from the top level directory of the
EMMPM Gui project:

git submodule init
git submodule update

Those 2 commands will checkout the appropriate versions of those projects.

Notes for Compilation:

The Code/MXA directory is a subset of the full MXADataModel distribution. I only
pulled in what was needed for this project. For the shared_pointers the implementation
from Qt is being used instead of the boost implementation. This reduces the number of
dependencies of the project.

You should have used git submodules to checkout the "CMP" and "emmpm" library projects
with the following command:

git submodu
